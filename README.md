# LudumDareGame

As described on our entry post,

This is a proof of concept for an action MMO written in C++ compiled to emscripten. In this release the server is compiled into the client; there is no back-end and no multiplayer. 

Features: potentially endless open world (unfinished) with Gauntlet-style combat (very unfinished). 

Built almost entirely from scratch. Libraries used are SDL, SDL_image, and tinyXML2. 

Controls: WASD to move, click to shoot.
